# üîß Technologies Used
## Frontend: React Native/Expo
React Native along with the Expo framework provides an optimal way of developing an application across platforms (iOS, Android, Web) within a single development environment. Expo Go allows for testing for the application on native devices without deploying the application.
## Backend: Firebase
Firebase brings simplicity to the management of backend functionality and communication between our application and database, especially in the long-term. It allows us to enable essential operations, such as logging/retrieving donations, creating data visualizations.

## Database: Firebase Firestore
Firestore meets the cost needs for the application while offering a powerful cloud database that can be scaled as needed. It also requires very little maintenance, and provides built-in security and authentication/authorization features that help make it secure and powerful.

### Bug Fixes
-N/A
### Known Issues
- Becasue our application is being developed for mobile platforms, Expo's development server on the web is not optimized and has some broken UI. However, the application, for the purposes of the artifact demo, works on mobile.
