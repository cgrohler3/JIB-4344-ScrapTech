# ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
## Frontend: React Native/Expo
React Native along with the Expo framework provides an optimal way of developing a mobile application. Expo Go allows for testing the application on native devices without deploying the application.
## Backend: Firebase
Firebase brings simplicity to the management of backend functionality and communication between our application and database, especially in the long-term. It allows us to enable essential operations such as logging/retrieving donations and creating data visualizations.

## Database: Firebase Firestore
Firestore meets the cost needs for the application while offering a powerful cloud database that can be scaled as needed. It also requires very little maintenance, and provides built-in security and authentication/authorization features that help make it secure and powerful.

### Bug Fixes
- UI fix on Log Donation corrected differences in font between header and content.
- Pie charts now update upon logging a donation without reloading the app.
- Removed visual delay in loading user routes in the navigation bar.
- Stopped view donations from querying the whole database and causing too many reads.
- Fixed Scraplanta logo appearing only partially on the screen.
- Changed error messages from being a catch all to being specific and giving guidance.
- Fixed category options in log donation failing to save due to â€˜/â€™ character by replacing with â€˜&â€™.
- Added loading activity to screens to prevent visual errors.
- Fixed UI consistency across screens.
- Replaced heat map spyglass icon with zoom icon to avoid confusing users.
- Added enough colors for all categories to be represented in pie charts.
- Fixed bug requiring zip code dropdown to be pressed twice to display charts.
### Known Issues
- Since the app was designed for android tablets, the UI is imperfect and the heat map is non-functional on iOS devices.
- Heat map centers itself upon first press of zoom, and then functions properly following this.
- While zip code input is limited to 5 digit integers, zip codes that do not exist are accepted in donation logging and taint the database.
- If all donations in view donations are deleted/empty, the green container still appears.
- Zip codes data view reloads on every visit, so colors may change when navigating away and back from this screen within the application.
- Deleting documents after donations have been logged with floating values (decimals) may cause undesired behavior. [e.g. 0.2 displaying as 0.20000000000001]
- Categories data view chart is not intuitively scrollable.
- There is no current method to edit donations, only to delete and then enter correctly.
